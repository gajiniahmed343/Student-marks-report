# Student-marks-report
This project gives information of a student such as Total marks, percentage and Grade.
The code is pretty simple to understand, I have used loops for entering the marks in the valid range and also to give which type of grade for different marks of he students.
I have used percentage formula to get percentage marks of the students.
