# Student-marks-report
This project gives an information of a student such as Total marks, percentage and Grade.
I have used python programming language to built this code.
The code was pretty simple to understand, I have used loops for entering the marks in the valid range and also to give which type of grade for different marks of he students.
I have used percentage formual to get percentage marks of the students.
So overall my code makes sense to build student marks report.
